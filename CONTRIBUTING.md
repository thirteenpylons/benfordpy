# Contributing to benfordpy
  
We welcome contributions to benfordpy of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, helping to manage issues, etc.

## Code Contribution Guidelines
    * Follow PIP8 Guidelines
    * Fork away and refactor | add code. I encourage pull requests to allow for review and discussion of code changes.
    * When creating a pull request:
        * Have test cases for the new code.
        * Add documentation if you are adding new features or changing functionality.
        * Converge commits. `git rebase -i`.
