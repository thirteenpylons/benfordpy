Newcomb-Benfords Law:
    Benford's Law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous
    numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency
    distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The
    law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading
    digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number
    1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9
    appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the
    digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the
    time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second
    digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.

Goal:
    Measure and plot the occurrence of integers[1:9] from 
    user provided dataset.
    Measure the occurrence of each integer in the first place value in set.
    Extended: measure and plot occurrence of int for each place value.
